# Test Case Generation for Asset Administration Shell REST APIs

The digital twin, or more precisely the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), is the key element for interoperability in Industrie 4.0. Together with the asset, it forms the I4.0 component. There are three different interfaces to access the AAS being a REST API one of them. To ensure interoperability of a given API it is necessary to ensure its compliance to the standard. This is done by testing the API. However, specifying test cases manually is costly and error-prone. That is why generating test cases automatically is desired. In this work existing test case generation methods for REST APIs shall be evaluated and extended for the testing of AAS REST APIs. The thesis has to work on the following tasks:

1. Evaluation of REST API test generation methods 
2. Selection of the appropriate method for this task based on criteria
3. Prototyping of an AAS REST API test case generator
4. Evaluation of the test case generator 
5. Discuss the test results and document the content of the tasks.
